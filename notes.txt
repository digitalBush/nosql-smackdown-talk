NoSQL Smackdown notes:

The goal is to try to help you wade through the myriad number of options. The number one thing I overhear people say is "I need to learn me some NoSQL" :(

NoSQL isn't a thing. It's just a category of things which it is not. 

Is NoSQL a fad?
How does it change programming style?
What is the most painful part?



CAP Theorem

How does the distributed system respond to node failures.

Failure Types:
 * Node dies.
   * Gone forver. Dead drive for instance.
   * Temporary. Reboot for instance.
 * Network Partition.
   * When that node is unreachable, then it's just as if the node went away temporarily.
   * What happens if the node is reachable from the outside, but can't talk to its peers?
